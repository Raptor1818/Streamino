# Streamino

Streamino is a locally-run webapp application that organizes your media all in one library. It organizes your movies (and soon, music) from various folders into one unified, easily accessible library. Experience seamless streaming of your personal collection, all in one place.

Built with Electron, React Typescript, and TailwindCSS. Still in early production, almost everything is subject to change.

Streamino is designed as a personal media organizer to enhance your experience with your own media collection. It does not facilitate the downloading, distribution, or access to media content not legally owned by the user. The app simply helps organize and streamline your existing media library, and responsibility for the legality of the media content rests solely with the user.

## What Streamino IS and IS NOT:
### Streamino IS:
- An app to create a personal library with a clean UI for a better watching experience of the media users already have on their devices.
### Streamino IS NOT:
- An app to enable users to download movies online illegaly.
